# File Permissions

Every file and directory on your Unix/Linux system is assigned 3 types of owner, given below.

* User
  A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner. Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner.

* Group
  A user- group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will have the same Linux group permissions access to the file.

* Other
  Any other user who has access to a file. This person has neither created the file, nor he belongs to a usergroup who could own the file. Practically, it means everybody else.
