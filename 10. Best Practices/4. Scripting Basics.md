# Scripting Basics

Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks, manage system operations, and streamline workflows on a Linux system. This guide covers the foundational concepts and practices of creating and using shell scripts.

## 1. Introduction to Shell Scripting

- **What is Shell Scripting?**
  - Shell scripting involves writing a sequence of commands in a file (a script) that the shell can execute to perform tasks automatically.
  - Commonly used for system administration, task automation, and simplifying repetitive tasks.

- **Why Use Shell Scripts?**
  - **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures tasks are performed the same way every time.
  - **Flexibility**: Can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple file operations to complex system administration tasks.

## 2. Shell Scripting Basics

### 2.1 Writing Your First Shell Script

- **Creating a Script File**:
  - Create a new file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `myscript.sh`).
  - Start the script with the shebang `#!` followed by the path to the shell.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ```
  - Add your commands below the shebang.

- **Basic Example**:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```
  - **Explanation**:
    - `#!/bin/bash`: Specifies the script should be run using the Bash shell.
    - `echo "Hello, World!"`: Prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

### 2.2 Making the Script Executable

- **Setting Execute Permissions**:
  - Use the `chmod` command to make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x myscript.sh
    ```
  - Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./myscript.sh
    ```

### 2.3 Variables in Shell Scripts

- **Defining Variables**:
  - Assign values to variables using the `=` operator:
    ```bash
    NAME="John"
    ```
  - Access the variable by prefixing it with `$`:
    ```bash
    echo "Hello, $NAME!"
    ```

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  NAME="Linux User"
  echo "Welcome, $NAME!"
  ```

### 2.4 Basic Input and Output

- **Reading User Input**:
  - Use the `read` command to get input from the user:
    ```bash
    echo "Enter your name:"
    read USERNAME
    echo "Hello, $USERNAME!"
    ```

- **Redirecting Output**:
  - Redirect command output to a file using `>`:
    ```bash
    echo "This is a log entry." > logfile.txt
    ```

- **Appending to a File**:
  - Append output to a file using `>>`:
    ```bash
    echo "This is another log entry." >> logfile.txt
    ```

## 3. Control Structures

### 3.1 Conditional Statements

- **`if` Statement**:
  - Used to execute code based on a condition:
    ```bash
    if [ "$USERNAME" == "admin" ]; then
      echo "Welcome, Administrator!"
    else
      echo "Access Denied."
    fi
    ```

- **Comparison Operators**:
  - Numeric comparisons: `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt`, `-ge`.
  - String comparisons: `==`, `!=`.

### 3.2 Loops

- **`for` Loop**:
  - Used to iterate over a list of items:
    ```bash
    for FILE in /path/to/directory/*; do
      echo "Processing $FILE"
    done
    ```

- **`while` Loop**:
  - Repeats a block of code while a condition is true:
    ```bash
    COUNTER=1
    while [ $COUNTER -le 5 ]; do
      echo "Counter: $COUNTER"
      ((COUNTER++))
    done
    ```

### 3.3 Case Statements

- **`case` Statement**:
  - Used to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable:
    ```bash
    case $1 in
      start)
        echo "Starting service..."
        ;;
      stop)
        echo "Stopping service..."
        ;;
      restart)
        echo "Restarting service..."
        ;;
      *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
        ;;
    esac
    ```

## 4. Functions in Shell Scripts

### 4.1 Defining Functions

- **Basic Function Definition**:
  - Define a function using the following syntax:
    ```bash
    my_function() {
      echo "This is a function"
    }
    ```

- **Calling a Function**:
  - Call the function by its name:
    ```bash
    my_function
    ```

### 4.2 Passing Arguments to Functions

- **Accessing Function Arguments**:
  - Function arguments are accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc.:
    ```bash
    greet() {
      echo "Hello, $1!"
    }
    greet "John"
    ```

### 4.3 Returning Values from Functions

- **Using `return`**:
  - Use the `return` command to exit a function with a status:
    ```bash
    add() {
      return $(($1 + $2))
    }
    add 3 5
    echo "Sum: $?"
    ```
  - Note that `return` is used for numeric status codes; to return strings or other values, use `echo`.

## 5. Scripting Best Practices

### 5.1 Code Readability

- **Use Comments**: 
  - Add comments to explain the purpose of code blocks:
    ```bash
    # This script greets the user
    echo "Hello, $USER!"
    ```

- **Consistent Naming**:
  - Use meaningful and consistent variable and function names.

### 5.2 Error Handling

- **Check Command Execution**:
  - Use `set -e` to exit the script if any command fails:
    ```bash
    set -e
    ```
  - Alternatively, check the exit status of commands using `$?`.

- **Use `trap` for Cleanup**:
  - Ensure resources are cleaned up in case of errors:
    ```bash
    trap "echo 'Cleaning up...'; exit" INT TERM
    ```

### 5.3 Testing and Debugging

- **Use `set -x` for Debugging**:
  - Enable script debugging to see each command before it's executed:
    ```bash
    set -x
    ```
  
- **Test Incrementally**:
  - Test scripts incrementally by adding and testing small sections of code.

## Conclusion

Shell scripting is a fundamental skill for Linux users and administrators, enabling automation and efficient system management. By mastering the basics of shell scripting, you can create powerful scripts to streamline tasks, manage systems, and improve productivity.
